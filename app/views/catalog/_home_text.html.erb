  <p>This is the test blacklight powered catalog for the Perseus Digital Library.</p>
  <p>To search, please enter your query in the search box above. If you'd like to browse, take a look at the limiting fields to the left.</p>
  <p>The optional search fields behave in the following way:</p>
    <dl class="dl-invert">
      <dt>Title</dt>
        <dd>The title search field will search and return work titles exclusively.</dd>
      <dt>Author</dt>
        <dd>The author search field searches all author standardized and alternate names.  It will return only records to authors, not their works.</dd>
      <dt>URN</dt>
        <dd>The URN search field accepts the standardized identifiers utilized by the Canonical Text Services (CTS) for text groups/authors, works, and versions.  The version level records, consisting of editions in the original language and translations in various languages, are identified by their full CTS URN.  <br>
        e.g. The text group Homer has the URN urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012; the work <em>Iliad</em> has the URN urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001; and lastly, the edition of the <em>Iliad</em>, published in 1931 and edited by Thomas W. Allen, has the URN urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-grcX1.  <br>
        When tlg0012 is searched on, it will return the text group, works, and version records.  tlg0012.tlg001 will return the works and versions.</dd>
